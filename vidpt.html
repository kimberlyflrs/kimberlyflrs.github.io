    <h3 class="bold">Our Goal</h3>
    <p>We aim to create a product that can improve the physical therapy 
      experience and allow users to receive the help they need. Since 
      this is a new app in the making, it was important to build the 
      user base and find our target audience.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <h3 class="bold">My Role</h3>
    <p>I was responsible for the product design and conducting user research. 
      I created quick prototype iterations and optimized the design flow 
      according to user feedback. I worked closely with the marketing team, 
      development team, and the project manager.</p>

<!--user research-->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <h2 class="bold">1. User Research</h2>
    <p>An online survey was conducted asking former patients 
      about their injury, attending physical therapy sessions, 
      and doing their rehab routine on their own. I conducted 
      30 minute interviews with former patients and a physical 
      therapist to understand the therapy experience.  I 
      analyzed over 200 survey results and 4 interview 
      transcripts and found the following information.</p>

    <h4>Target user analysis based on survey and interviews</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">70% of patients receive sketch drawings or handwritten 
        notes about their routine.</span> Users often have to look up 
        external sources to understand their routine.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Users do not know their progress until they go visit 
        their physical therapist.</span></li>
      <li><span class="bold">Cost/Insurance, Lack of PT communication, and time 
        spent with PT are the reasons users drop </span> out of their 
        physical therapy.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Personalization.</span>Users receive basic routines from 
        their PT but there is personalization according to 
        each patient’s progress.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Users consider the recovery journey a lonesome one.</span> 
        There are not a lot of support groups or they cannot 
        find someone to talk to going through the same experience.</li>

<!--Design Considerations-->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <h2 class="bold">3. Design Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Add multiple ways to understand routine.</span> 
        Traditional PT patients receive diagrams or 
        paper notes describing each exercise. However, 
        they still look up the exercise online to know 
        how to do each move and jot down more notes for 
        understanding.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Add progress metrics.</span> 65% past patients mentioned 
        that it is difficult to know if they were making 
        any progress. </li>
      <li><span class="bold">Personalize each routine.</span> In order to mimic how 
        PTs evaluate each patient, they told us that they 
        start with a generic routine and based on the 
        progress, they start changing the sets/reps, 
        adding/removing exercises based on the patient’s 
        ability.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Connect with others.</span> Former patients wish they 
        could talk to someone that has gone through the 
        same experience. </li>
      <li><span class="bold">Connect with PT.</span> For the users that are working 
        with a PT, it is important to have some way to 
        receive updates from them</li>
    </ul>

      <img class="solutionpics" src="assests/vidpt/vidpt-wireframe.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <p>I invited stakeholders to check out a clickable 
        wireframe set made on Adobe XD. We went through 
        each screen but it was proving to be inefficient. 
        I then composed a visual that encompassed all the 
        screens. This allowed us to view the content more 
        clearly and see how each screen is connected to one 
        another. It also helped with identifying any problems. 
        We took notes about individual screens and the overall 
        user flow.</p>

    <h2 class="bold">5. Mid Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
    <h4>Progress Tracking</h4>
    <p>We asked former patients what metrics they would have 
      liked to have known throughout their journey and agreed 
      to track the following: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Calendar Tracker [Keep track of routines completed]</li>
      <li>Strength/Pain levels</li>
      <li>Routines Completed</li>
      <li>Time Sent</li>
    </ol>


    <h4>Editing Routines</h4>
    <p>When talking to former patients, they mentioned how 
      they would look up videos of each exercise in order to 
      perform it correctly and write out their own notes. The 
      components added to the Edit Screens are:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <ol class="center">
            <li>Video with audio describing the movement</li>
            <li>Adjust sets and reps</li>
            <li>Descriptive notes</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">

        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Interacting with other users</h4>
    <p>We want to create a supportive community by allowing 
      patients to connect with one another and sharing 
      their experiences through posts. Users can make a 
      comment and like each post. Users can check out other 
      user’s profiles and learn more about them. </p>

      <h4>Interacting with Physical Therapists</h4>
      <p>It was important to have a way for patients to still 
        receive care from their PT so we developed a Web 
        Application for PTs to keep track of their patients, 
        send notes, and modify the patient’s routine. 
        Users will receive messages through notifications 
        and see PT notes on a designated tab.

<!--usability testing-->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <h2 class="bold">6. Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>I created low-fidelity prototypes to test 5 users who 
      did and didn’t have physical therapy experience. The 
      test focused on the sign up process, editing and 
      completing a routine, progress checks, and 
      interacting with other users. We looked at how users 
      interact with the app, what are the users’ needs, and 
      in what context do they use each feature.</p>  

    <h4>Feedback from participants</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Participants found the sign up process too long.</span> 
        Initially the sign up process contained a custom 
        quiz to get a personalize routine but the 
        questions were too much.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Most participants found it difficult to add 
        reminders to each exercise.</span> The reminders were 
        hidden behind a ‘+’ dropdown and users often 
        skipped this area.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Most participants agreed that a weekly check on 
        their progress was a good decision.</span> Anything more 
        frequent would be considered tiresome and anything 
        less would prove the progress section useless.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Participants had a difficult time finding the 
        make a post button</span> located on the upper-left 
        hand corner.</li>

    <h2 class="bold">7. Iteration Based on Research Findings</h2>
    <h4>Sign Up Flow</h4>
    <p>After talking to the marketing team, we decided to 
      move the custom starter routine quiz to be part of 
      the premium plan. I minimized the number of screens 
      needed to sign up from 8 to 3 screens. </p>

    <h4>Edit Routine Flow</h4>
    <p>I removed the reminders from being tucked in the ‘+’ 
      icon to having them available in a different section 
      where the option of making a note is always available.</p>
      <img class="solutionpics" src="assests/vidpt/edit_exercise.png" alt="Edit screen"/>
      <h4>Posting</h4>
      <p>I moved the Post icon to the lower right hand corner 
        as a floating button. The icon was also changed 
        from a ‘+’ sign to a pencil and paper icon.</p>

    <p>
      After finishing the final version, I presented the 
      prototype to my boss and development team but they 
      had a difficult time understanding the flow. In 
      order to address this problem, I decided to break 
      up the prototype into different use cases. I also 
      created a document that highlights how each screen 
      is connected and the interactions for each one.</p>

    <h2 class="bold">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      I wish I could’ve conducted more usability tests in 
      person but we had to halt it due to Covid-19. 
      However, I was able to adjust to the situation 
      and I conducted the tests remotely using Useberry 
      and had calls with our participants about the test. 
      I made a clear plan to explain to the test users 
      what tasks they were going to accomplish on their 
      computer screens. The alternative plan allowed us 
      to stay on track with the project and save resources.</p>
