        <h4 class="vpt bold">overview</h4>
        <p>VidPT is a physical therapy mobile application that
          allows patients to do their rehab routine on their own
          or with supervision from a physical therapist(PT).<p>
      </div>
    </div>

<h4 class="bold vpt">problem statement</h4>
<p>
  During September 2018-March 2019, my senior design team were tasked with
  helping VidPT create a mobile app. The app sought to relieve physical
  therapy pain points such as patients starting their rehab routine late
  due to medical insurance, trying to understand drawings and instructions
  for exercises, and help patients feel motivated through their journey.
  However, the team created an MVP that didn’t have all the features implemented.
  Now, VidPT is looking for a redesign of the app to attract more users in need
  of physical therapy and physical therapists.

<h4 class="bold vpt">evaluation of current app</h4>
<p>
  I talked with the founder, Michael about the features he wanted
  to implement and evaluated the state of the app.
  <b>The app has the following problems:<br>
  •	Limited progress information<br>
  •	No personalization for solo patients<br>
  •	No physical therapist interface to connect with patients<br>
  •	Fails to keep users engaged<br>
  •	Looks like a regular workout app<br></b>

<p>
  Before getting started, I decided to <b>compare existing fitness applications to view their features.</b>
  The team decided that we should <b>allow users to do a rehab routine on their own.</b> Most routines
  are standard and the routine our users would receive would be created with input from a
  physical therapist. I decided it would be best to <b>ignore the timer feature.</b> Physical
  therapy focuses on performing each exercise correctly and we want to prevent injuries.

    <h4 class="vpt bold">user research</h4>
    <p class="bold">
      surveys and interviews
    </p>
    <p>
      An <b>online survey</b> was conducted asking former patients about their injury, attending
      physical therapy, and doing their rehab routine on their own. <b>30-minute interviews</b> were
      conducted with former physical therapy patients and a physical therapist.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">
      findings
    </p>
    <p>
      I <b>analyzed over 200 survey results and 4 interview transcripts</b> and found the following information.
    </p>
    <p>  ■	Target audience is between the ages 31-45.</p>
      <p>■	Top issues with the physical therapy process are cost/insurance, communication with the
        physical therapist, and time spent in the PT office.</p>
      <p>■	70% of patients receive sketch drawings or handwritten notes about their routine.</p>
      <p>■	Rehab routine and intensity is based on the rehab goal of the patient.</p>

    <p>
      I created the following <b>personas to reflect who the VidPT users are.</b>

      <b>Unlike a diagram or an image, looking at a video allows the user to see how the exercise is

    <p>
      After each week, patients will be prompted to <b>take a progress survey that asks about their current pain
      level, current strength level, and ability to do everyday things</b>. According to our <b>interview with the
      physical therapist</b>, this is vital information to determine a new routine for patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a Workout Average Chart that allows users to see how much time they spend doing their
      rehab routine and the Calendar Tracker allows patients to view days they rested, skipped, and worked out.

    <p>
      A common issue found in our interview and survey data is that physical therapy was
      feeling lonely due to not having people with a similar experience around. The Brag Wall is
      the community section of the app which <b>allows patients to connect with one another by posting
      questions, accomplishments, and positive messages.</b>

    <h6 class="bold">solo routine</h6>
    <p>
      Patients using the app without the PT assistance can edit their routine with a library of color-coded
      exercises that target their specific injury. For each exercise there is a recommended amount of
      sets/reps which can only be adjusted to a smaller amount. <b>I suggested adding new exercises in the
      library for a patient if they made progress on the weekly surveys to mimic how in-person physical therapy.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
       Patients can add their own notes to view during their routine. However, if the patient is
       working with a physical therapist, then the PT is responsible for making the
       changes to the routine such as picking exercises and adding notes.

    <p>
      Physical Therapists can monitor their patients progress through the app. They are <b>able to add a
      patient, edit a patient’s routine, and view their progress.</b> PTs are notified when a patient
      completes a weekly progress check or not performing well and can view/use those results to
      make changes to the routine. This information is reflected on the home screen. At the moment,
      PTs cannot message a patient through the app but
      this feature will be designed for future iterations.

      As of right now, the project is ongoing and there will be more testing and design changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this experience, <b>I am learning how to improve my research and testing skills</b>. I gathered
      great information from former patients but I need to <b>learn more about the physical therapist role.</b>
      I believe an <b>ethnographic study on physical therapists</b> would help reveal their routine and I can
      learn more about what needs to be improved between the PT-Patient relation. Also, I am learning how
       to <b>improve the interview protocol to gather relevant information.</b> I am analyzing each question and
       asking myself what is the purpose of the question and what do I want to get out of it? <b>I will be
       implementing these new research techniques while the app is still ongoing.</b>
