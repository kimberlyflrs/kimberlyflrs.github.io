        <p>VidPT is a physical therapy mobile application that
          allows patients to do their rehab routine on their own
          or with supervision from a physical therapist(PT).<p>

<h4 class="bold vpt">problem statement</h4>
<p>
  The physical therapy process can be an overwhelming experience to the patient.
  Patients may not start their rehab routine immediately(perhaps months later) due to
  finding a facility that accepts their medical insurance. And once they start the process,
  patients are often given poorly sketched drawings or instructions explaining the exercises
  they need to do. How can physical therapy become simple and not overwhelming?

<p>
I took a look at direct competitors such as Therapydia and ForceTherapeutics to
know how what features are included. I also looked at indirect competitors, Nike Training Club
and 24HR Fitness to view their workout feature. The team decided that we should allow users to do a rehab routine on their own.

    <h4 class="vpt bold">user research</h4>
    <p class="bold">
      surveys and interviews
    </p>
    <p>
      An online survey was conducted asking former patients about their injury, attending
      physical therapy, and doing their rehab routine on their own. 30-minute interviews were
      conducted with former physical therapy patients and a physical therapist.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">
      findings
    </p>
    <p>
      I analyzed over 200 survey results and 4 interview transcripts and found the following information.
    </p>
    <p>  ■	Target audience is between the ages 31-45.</p>
      <p>■	Top issues with the physical therapy process are cost/insurance, communication with the
        physical therapist, and time spent in the PT office.</p>
      <p>■	70% of patients receive sketch drawings or handwritten notes about their routine.</p>
      <p>■	Rehab routine and intensity is based on the rehab goal of the patient.</p>

    <p>
      I created the following personas to reflect who the VidPT users are.

    <p>
      There was a moment when I thought the design was good enough but that was because I had been working on the
      flow for so many hours. I conducted a cognitive walkthrough with the same cases from the usability test and
      the main goal of the walkthrough was to see if the users could recognize the next step in the flow.

      The signup process for patients was too long (8-9 screens) and there was no indicator stating
      where in the process the user was at. My solution is to add an indicator or progress bar and reduce the number
      of interactions and screens in the process. When testing with the PT, they mentioned that the home page lacked
      content. When I asked what type of information is prioritized in their day to day work, they mentioned knowing
      which patients needed to be seen immediately, such as those who were not making progress.

    <h6 class="bold">use of video</h6>
    <p>
      Unlike a diagram or an image, looking at a video allows the user to see how the exercise is
      performed from different angles. The user doesn’t have to try recalling how the therapist
      performed the move since the video will always be there for reference. The user can pause the
      video and recollect themselves from trying the move. VidPTs exercise videos have audio which will
       provide more information on how to properly perform each move.

    <h6 class="bold">track progress through weekly surveys</h6>
    <p>
      After each week, patients will be prompted to take a progress survey that asks about their current pain
      level, current strength level, and ability to do everyday things. According to our interview with the
      physical therapist, this is vital information to determine a new routine for patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a Workout Average Chart that allows users to see how much time they spend doing their
      rehab routine and the Calendar Tracker allows patients to view days they rested, skipped, and worked out.

    <h6 class="bold">brag wall</h6>
    <p>
      A common issue found in our interview and survey data is that physical therapy was
      feeling lonely due to not having people with a similar experience around. The Brag Wall is
      the community section of the app which allows patients to connect with one another by posting
      questions, accomplishments, and positive messages.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-6 my-auto">
    <h6 class="bold">solo routine</h6>
    <p>
      Patients using the app without the PT assistance can edit their routine with a library of color-coded
      exercises that target their specific injury. For each exercise there is a recommended amount of
      sets/reps which can only be adjusted to a smaller amount. I suggested adding new exercises in the
      library for a patient if they made progress on the weekly surveys.
    </p>
    <p>
       Patients can add their own notes to view during their routine. However, if the patient is
       working with a physical therapist, then the PT is responsible for making the
       changes to the routine such as picking exercises and adding notes.

    <h6 class="bold">physical therapists connect</h6>
    <p>
      Physical Therapists can monitor their patients progress through the app. They are able to add a
      patient, edit a patient’s routine, and view their progress. PTs are notified when a patient
      completes a weekly progress check or not performing well and can view/use those results to
      make changes to the routine. At the moment, PTs cannot message a patient through the app but
      this feature will be designed for future iterations.

      As of right now, the project is ongoing and there will be more testing and design changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this experience, I am learning how to improve my research and testing skills. I gathered
      great information from former patients but I need to learn more about the physical therapist role.
      I believe an ethnographic study on physical therapists would help reveal their routine and I can
      learn more about what needs to be improved between the PT-Patient relation. Also, I am learning how
       to improve the interview protocol to gather relevant information. I am analyzing each question and
       asking myself what is the purpose of the question and what do I want to get out of it? I will be
       implementing these new research techniques while the app is still ongoing.
