        <h4 class="es bold">overview</h4>
        <p>Our mobile app, EcoStat, aims to help users understand
          how their utility usage impacts the environment. EcoStat uses IoT devices and
          utility company information to determine how the user uses gas, water,
          and electricity at home. <p>
      </div>

<h4 class="bold es">problem statement</h4>
<p>
Figuring out your environmental impact through utility bills can be confusing.
These bills often show an illustration of a monthly breakdown of how much
was used and rarely is there information provided on individual days or a
recommended usage amount. Water, Gas, and Electric are all measured in
different units which makes it difficult for users to know how those levels
 of usage impact the environment. Many people would like to make changes
 for the environment but find it hard to stay motivated when their impact
 is not seen quickly. How can we show environmental impacts through utility use?

      Before starting the project, we needed to <b>know if there was a market for
      our product</b>. We focused on problems, solutions, product advantages, and
      early adopters in the lean canvas. We then researched our early adopters through the value
      proposition canvas. The team <b>defined what pain points the customer faced
      and how our product will provide a solution</b>.

<p>
  I conducted a competitive analysis on apps that focus on showing the users their
  impact on the environment. I looked into features and <b>used their strengths and
  weaknesses to better design our product.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Our team noticed that these products do not use IoT devices and require users to
  manually input data. We decided to use IoT devices and information from utility
  companies to track utility use throughout the day. Another feature we considered
  adding was an award system in order to keep users engaged.

      surveys and interviews

    <p>
      I wanted to find out <b>what the users of EcoStat are like (eco-friendly habits, utility habits, etc)</b>.
      We targeted people age 18-30 years old because they tend to be tech-savy and more conscious
      about their decisions affecting the environment. I created a short <b>survey and conducted
      30-minute semi-structured interviews</b> to gather information about pain points in utility usage in
      connection with the environment.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">
      findings
    </p>
    <p>
      I <b>analyzed over 23 survey results and 5 interview sessions</b> and found the following information.
    </p>
    <p>  ■  only 20% of our early adopters (ages 18-30) knew about their impact on the environment
      based on their household utility usage</p>
      <p>■	60% of early adopters find it hard to set personal utility limits</p>
      <p>■	Early adopters want to be eco-friendly and gather tips online and through social media</p>

      When participants were given the task, “Look at Weekly Water Usage”,
      we defined the flow to be the green path. However, <b>our participants ignored the

      why they didn’t click on the calendar tab they stated that they
      noticed the tab but didn’t think much about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After discovering this, <b>I suggested to the UX Designers that we needed to
      remove the calendar tab</b> as we are displaying the same data on the Home page.

      In order to <b>show usage effectively to the user</b>, we decided on three methods:<br>

      •	Meter- A <b>circular graph</b> displaying usage<br>
      •	Tree- a <b>visual representation</b> of a growing tree, as usage increases then the tree starts to deprecate
    </p>
    <p>
      We decided to convert those metrics into a single number. Each utility starts at a score of
      40 totaling up to 120 for all three utilities. The score is compared to their EcoLimit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As users increase their usage, their score decreases and is reflected through the three methods.
      EcoScores reset each day at 40 and 120.

      The bar graph lets users see hourly usage information for the day, week, month,
      or year. The horizontal bar graph shows how close users are to their EcoLimit.
      As usage increases, the bar starts getting closer to the limit and changing to a

      EcoTiers are earned when users consistently get EcoScores of 100 and above.

      I learned that the best way to <b>build a product is by involving the users

      needs is by asking them and testing each prototype with them. When I tested
      the prototypes we found that some <b>users reacted differently than us.</b> This
      was great because it confirms that we are not our users. The users know
      what their needs are and not us. We gained great feedback from them which
      was then utilized to <b>create user-friendly solutions in the interface.</b>
