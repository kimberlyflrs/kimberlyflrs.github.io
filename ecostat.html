        <p class="bold center">My team was tasked with tackling an environmental issue with IoT (Internet of Things) devices. 
          We proceeded to create EcoStat, a mobile app, that allows users to understand how their utility usage from 
          smart devices impacts the environment. I was responsible for conducting user and product research and usability testing.

    <h3 class="bold">Intro</h3>
    <p>EcoStat is an MVP (minimum viable product) that aims to help users understand how their utility 
      usage through data visualization. EcoStat uses IoT devices (smart lights, smart thermostat, etc.) 
      and utility company information to determine how the user uses gas, water, and electricity at home. 
      By understanding their use, users can make environmental conscious decisions and stay motivated with 
      our app.</p>

    <h3 class="bold">My Role</h3>
    <p>I was responsible for conducting research and testing of our product. I 
      looked into user behaviors when it comes to the environment, potential competitors,
      and resources for the development team. I conducted surveys, interviews, cognitive 
      walkthroughs, and usability tests. I worked closely with the UX designer to create 
      the app.

    <h2 class="bold">1. Problem with Utility Bills</h2>
    <p>
      Figuring out your environmental impact through utility bills can be confusing. These 
      bills often show an illustration of a monthly breakdown of how much was used and rarely is 
      there information provided on individual days or a recommended usage amount. Water, Gas, and 
      Electric are all measured in different units which makes it difficult for users to know how 
      those levels of usage impact the environment. Many people would like to make changes for the 
      environment but find it hard to stay motivated when their impact is not seen quickly. How can 
      we show environmental impacts through utility use?

    <h2 class="bold">2. MVP Goals</h2>
    <h4>Lean Canvas and Value Proposition</h4>
    <p>
      Before starting the project, we needed to know if there was a market for
      our product. We focused on problems, solutions, product advantages, and
      early adopters in the lean canvas. We then researched our early adopters through the value
      proposition canvas. The team defined what pain points the customer faced
      and how our product will provide a solution.

  <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <h2 class="bold">3. Understanding our users and competitors</h2>
    <p>The next step was to understand what pain points and needs our early adopters 
      have when it comes to their utility bills. 
    
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <img src="assests/ecostat/competitiveanalysis.png" class="solutionpics">
    <p class="center">Figure 2. Competitive Analysis Diagram</p>
    <p>Also, I looked into what features 
      the competitor products had and used their strengths and weaknesses to better 
       design our product. 
    </p>

    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
    <p>
      We targeted people age 18-30 years old because they tend to be tech-savy and more conscious
      about their decisions affecting the environment.They tend to have smart devices in their homes which 
      is what our app levarages. </p>

    <h4>Survey and Interview</h4>
    <p>I wanted to find out what our early adopters were like (eco-friendly habits, utility habits, etc).
      I created a short survey and conducted
      30-minute semi-structured interviews to gather information about pain points in utility usage in
      connection with the environment.</p>



    <h4>Results from User and Competitor Research</h4>
    <p>
      I analyzed over 23 survey results and 5 interview sessions and found the following information.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Competitors do not use IoT devices and require users to manually input data.</li>
      <li>Competitors have a gamification aspect to keep users engaged.</li>
      <li>Only 20% of our early adopters (ages 18-30) knew about their impact on the environment
      based on their household utility usage</li>
      <li>60% of early adopters find it hard to set personal utility limits</li>
      <li>Early adopters want to be eco-friendly and gather tips online and through social media</li>
    </ul>

      features for tackling user pain points.</p>

    <h2 class="bold">5. User Testing</h2>
    <h4>Define Testing Protocol</h4>
    <p>I recruited 5 participants that fit the description of our target audience. I created 
      5 tasks for our users to test that contains all of the features of the app. The tasks 
      focused on being able to locate feature on the app and understand the data presented to them. 
      Testing lasted 30 minutes for each participant and was followed with additional questioning on their experience.
      </p>


    <h4>Usability Test</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5 Participants, 1 Facilitator, 1 Moderator</li>
      <li>Measurements: Completion Rate, Mistakes Made, User Flow, and Time to complete task</li>
      <li>5 tasks were given to the user</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Task 1: Imagine you are curious about how much water
            your househould uses in a week. How would you go about it?</li>
          <li>Task 2: Imagine you are using the app and you notice your
            electricity is being used a lot. How would you go about finding a tip about
            reducing electricity?</li>
          <li>Task 3: Where would you go to connect your smart device to the app?</li>
          <li>Task 4: Find "User X" and give them a like for achieving a new  accomplishment. </li>
          <li>Task 5: ///// </li>
        </ul>

    </ul>


    <h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
    <p>
      I took the five tasks from the usability test and broke them into smaller subtasks to learn if the 
      participants can recognize their next step in the user flow.

    <p>From the testing, I passed this information to the UX Designer. I suggested that we 
      removed the Calendar tab as it was ignored by our participants. I also recommended adding
      an information icon that would explain to the user what each metric means.

    <h4>Connect Usage And Impact Through EcoScore</h4>
    <p>
      In order to <b>show usage effectively to the user</b>, we decided on three methods:<br>
      •	EcoScore- a <b>numerical representation</b><br>
      •	Meter- A <b>circular graph</b> displaying usage<br>
      •	Tree- a <b>visual representation</b> of a growing tree, as usage increases then the tree starts to deprecate
    </p>
    <p>
      We decided to convert those metrics into a single number. Each utility starts at a score of
      40 totaling up to 120 for all three utilities. The score is compared to their EcoLimit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As users increase their usage, their score decreases and is reflected through the three methods.
      EcoScores reset each day at 40 and 120.

      When the user signs up, the <b>app collects information on household size,
      location, and time of year to create a recommended usage amount (EcoLimit).</b>
      The bar graph lets users see hourly usage information for the day, week, month,
      or year. The horizontal bar graph shows how close users are to their EcoLimit.
      As usage increases, the bar starts getting closer to the limit and changing to a
      red color, warning the user.

      In order to keep our users motivated, we found that a <b>community and gamification</b>
      were the best solution. Users can connect with other users and celebrate their
      achievements such as earning new EcoTiers and hitting EcoScore streaks.
      EcoTiers are earned when users consistently get EcoScores of 100 and above.

       Having a social feed allows users to keep each other accountable and motivated,

  <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <h2 class="bold">What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One round of testing isn’t enough. Due to the time constraint, we were only able to fit in one 
        round of testing for the first prototype. It would have been helpful to know if the new design 
        changes improved the user experience. Next time, we should start testing very early in order 
        to fit in another round of testing after design changes were made.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a testing environment. When we conducted our tests, we did it in public but the problem 
        was that there were too many distractions present (loud noise, other people around). 
        This environment distracted some of our participants which skewed some time results. 
        It is better to test in a quiet environment where the participant can focus on the task.
